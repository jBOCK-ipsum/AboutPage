# -1-_About_Page
This is a mini-project used as an introduction to JavaScript and what it has to offer in the realm of frontend web development.

This uses an onclick function to change content within a mutual div on an 'about me' section. I hope to continue these sort of mini-projects and incorporate them into any larger websites/applications that I may create.
